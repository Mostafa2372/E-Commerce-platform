ðŸ“¦ Fecom Inc. Data Integration & Analytics Platform
ðŸ“˜ Introduction
1.1 Background
Modern e-commerce platforms face significant challenges in managing and analyzing data from multiple heterogeneous sources, such as transactional databases, NoSQL systems, and real-time user activity streams. Fecom Inc., an e-commerce marketplace, encountered the need to integrate data from different sourcesâ€”SQL Server, MongoDB, and user clickstreamsâ€”to derive meaningful insights for business decision-making and improve customer experience.â€‹

1.2 Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to build a scalable and integrated data management solution that consolidates data from diverse sources into a centralized Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL Server. The system supports reporting, analytics, and business intelligence (BI) via Power BI dashboards to empower decision-makers with real-time, actionable insights.â€‹

1.3 Previous Work Done (Competitor Analysis)
Competitor analysis revealed the use of robust data pipelines, integrated recommendation systems, and strong data visualization tools. These platforms utilize real-time analytics (often powered by Kafka and Spark) and modern BI tools. Fecom Inc. aims to adopt similar architectural strategies at a feasible scale.â€‹
